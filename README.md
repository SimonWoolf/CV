# Simon Woolf

Young [programmer|maths geek|physics geek]. As of June, full-time developer in [Econsultancy's tech team](https://econsultancy.com/about/tech). Experienced mostly with Ruby-based stacks (sinatra & rails), but very happy to work with any technology that'd be fun to learn. Email me at simon@simonwoolf.net to talk about anything, though I'm afraid I'm unable to take on freelance work while at Econsultancy.

A pdf version of this CV (with corresponding LaTeX source) can be downloaded above.

## Languages & skills

**Ruby** &ndash; Multiple projects, including webapps in **Rails** and **Sinatra**. My current favourite language

**Python** &ndash; Various computational mathematics scripts and electromagnetic field lines visualisation project, as part of my degree

**Unix** &ndash; Used Linux in various forms since uni, mostly debian-based distros. Poor to middling bash scripter &mdash; I tend to go to ruby or python for any more than trivial scripts

**Miscellanious webdev** &ndash; **javascript** (& **jQuery** ), **HTML** / **CSS**. Tend to like using preprocessors for most of those (coffeescript, haml, sass/scss, and the like) for big rails projects

**Maths & Physics** &ndash; In addition to my degree, have tutored A-level maths and physics in my spare time for a few years now

Miscellanious &ndash; **LaTeX**. **Vim** user (vimmer? vimist? vimian?), but haven't yet got up the courage to properly learn vimscript. Dabbled in **Java** to make an Android app I wanted, but wasn't a big fan

Of course, very happy to learn new things not in this list :)

## Education

### 2006 – 2010 University of Cambridge
**BA MSci, Mathematics With Physics** Took the three year Mathematics BA (in first year, also took the Physics part of the NatSci tripos), followed by the fourth year of the NatSci Physics MSci.

### 2011 – 2013 Queen Mary, University of London
**Law LLB** Sidetrack into a Law conversion course. Got excellent results (and was a quarter-finalist in the ESU national moot), but luckily realised that I wanted to be a programmer rather than a lawyer before going too far down that road.

### 2013 – 2014 Makers Academy
Intensive twelve-week programming & web development course. Teaches programming best practices (TDD, software design, version control, agile), using ruby with sinatra, rails, HTML and CSS, javascript & jQuery, etc. Took it to get a firm grounding of programming & webdev essentials, and get rid of all the bad habits I'd built up doing scientific programming...
